Project Description
===================================================

**Fantasy Genre Extractor** A prototype tool to investigate the feasibility of automatic sub-genre extraction from a sample fantasy text.

This prototype was produced as part of the thesis **Automatic Genre Analysis of Fantasy Fiction** by N. Z. Khupe submitted to the Institute of Information and Communication Technology in partial fullfilment of the requirements for the degree of B.Sc. (Hons.) Software Development.

Motivation and Aims
========================
The motivation behind this research stems from a common problem encountered by readers of online fictional stories where it is common to find stories being placed in genres which do not wholly fit the story line; at times this can be done intentionally to boost the appearance of a story in search results by having it fall under multiple genre categories rather than just the appropriate ones. Research has already been carried out into extracting the main genres from literature.

The aim of this research is to expand on this existing research to produce a tool which can automatically determine the sub-genre for fictional literature falling under the Fantasy genre. This will provide an accurate way of sub classifying online literature for the benefit of readers and also for moderation purposes to ensure that authors are not intentionally uploading stories under the wrong sub-genre to increase appearances in search results and therefore also  increase the possibility of their work being read. Alternatively, it could be used to assign initial genres which can be modified from reader feedback at a later point.

This topic was initially a linguistics problem until recommended it's utility as an information retrieval task. In the recent past research has focused more in the genre classification of web pages. used a genre scoring method to rank genres in literature. She used this technique to determine the main genres in a piece of literature. The results were in the form thriller, fantasy, sci-fi, adventure and horror with attached scores.

This research will focus on further sub classification of English fictional text which fall under the main genre of fantasy. The results are expected to be in the form science fantasy, dark fantasy, juvenile fantasy and generic fantasy.
